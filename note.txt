Mobile-Friendly Design: All elements should be responsive and adapt well to smaller screens. The table might need horizontal scrolling or a card-based layout on mobile.
Local Storage: The app should automatically save game progress (player names, scores, rounds) to local storage so users can pick up where they left off.
